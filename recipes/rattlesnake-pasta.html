    <h2>Ingredients</h1>

      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped pickled jalape単os, plus extra slices for serving</li>
      <li>1 large clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
      <li>12 ounces dried penne pasta </li>
      <li>4 cups unsalted chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 large red bell pepper, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy whipping cream </li>
      <li>1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (6 ounces) grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (2 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese, divided</li>
      <li>Hot sauce, optional (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h1>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>Cook the jalape単os and garlic: </h3>
        <p>Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the jalape単os and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cook the chicken and pasta:</h3>
        <p>Stir in the chicken, pasta, and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. </p>
        <p> Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring often, until the pasta is al dente with a bit of liquid left at the bottom of the Dutch oven, 10 to 12 minutes. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Make the sauce: </h3>
        <p>Uncover and stir in the bell pepper, cream, and salt until combined. </p>
        <p>Remove the pot from the heat. Gradually add the Parmesan in 2 or 3 additions, stirring until smooth before adding more cheese. Add 1/4 cup of the cheddar cheese and stir until smooth. Season to taste with additional salt. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Garnish and serve: </h3>
        <p>Divide the pasta among 4 shallow serving bowls and top evenly with the remaining 1/4 cup cheddar cheese. Drizzle with hot sauce, if desired, and top with more Parmesan and jalape単os. Serve immediately. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
