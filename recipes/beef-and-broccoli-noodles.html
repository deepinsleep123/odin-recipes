  <h1>Beef and Broccoli Noodles</h1> 

  <p>For four servings you will need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>1/4 cup hoisin sauce</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce or tamari </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch </li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, grated </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger </li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef </li>
    <li>1 head (10 to 12 ounces) broccoli, cut into bite-sized pieces </li>
    <li>8 ounces dried Chinese noodles, thin egg noodles, ramen, udon, or soba noodles</li>
    <li>Optional garnishes: sliced green onions, sesame seeds</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In a large measuring cup, mix together the water, hoisin, soy sauce, mirin, and cornstarch. Grate the garlic and ginger directly into the sauce mixture and set aside.  </p>
  <p>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and use a spatula to break into large pieces, then let the beef cook undisturbed for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the broccoli followed by the sauce mixture. Cover and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.  </p>
  <p>Uncover, use the spoon or spatula to push the beef and broccoli towards the edge of the pan, and add the noodles. Cover again and cook for an additional 4 to 5 minutes. The dish is done when the sauce has thickened and the noodles are tender. Serve with sliced green onions and sesame seeds, if desired.</p>
